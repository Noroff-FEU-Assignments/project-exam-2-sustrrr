This website is made for a local tourism agency in Bergen, here users can book hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses in bergen. Users can search for different accommodations and make booking enquires. This website uses Wordpress API, where all the accommodations is stored.
Users can send contact messages to Holidaze, this info goes to the API and the admin can log into the site to view the contact messages. The booking enquires goes to the API as well, and it gets displayed on the dashboard for the admin.

An admin with the correct login information can log into the site. Here the admin can see a list of booking enquiries, contact messages and the admin can add a new establishment.
